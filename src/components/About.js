      <p>
        My name is Lisa and I am a developer and musician based in Toronto.  When the pandemic struck, I found myself taking on tech responsibilities in ways that I hadn't done before.  I continue to train through the UofT SCS full-stack coding bootcamp.  Upcoming solo projects include Frankenzinc, a site profiling one man's quest to build his own racecar from scratch, as well as a musical database cataloguing the complete works of contemporary composer/pianist Christopher Kies.
